\section{Conclusion}
\replaced{We designed and evaluated}{In this work, we present} an exemplar-based \added{graph} layout fine-tuning approach that reduces human labor by transferring modifications made on an exemplar to other substructures. 
A user interface is developed to enable fine-tuning of graph layouts.
A quantitative comparison of two datasets with ground truth indicates that our approach can reach more accurate correspondences. Three case studies show that our approach works well on different datasets and layouts. A user study shows that our approach significantly reduces or even eliminates laborious interactions.
