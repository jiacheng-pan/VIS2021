\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We design and implement \ApproachName, an approach to generating descriptions for node-link diagrams automatically.
\ApproachName~focuses on describing creation of node-link diagrams: graph wrangling, visual encoding, and layout computing.
It extracts crucial information from these three steps and fills templates to generate descriptions.
Our approach is a fully automatic technique that does not require complex interactions to generate its descriptions.
The case studies and the user study demonstrate its usability and effectiveness.

We envision improving \ApproachName~in several directions.
Certain kinds of visual elements such as \texttt{<path>} and \texttt{<polyline>} are not yet supported.
We plan to support more kinds of shapes and visual channels.
Moreover, we plan to support generating descriptions for raster images by transforming raster images to SVGs.
Furthermore, more kinds of descriptions can be incorporated into \ApproachName.
We also expect to generate descriptions of the meaning of data attributes, the intention of a layout, and deeper insights with graph mining methods.
