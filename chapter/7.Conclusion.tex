\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
We design and implement an approach, \ApproachName~to generate descriptions for node-link diagrams automatically.
\ApproachName~focuses on describing the creation process of node-link diagrams: graph wrangling, visual encoding, and layout computing.
It extracts curcial information from the three steps and fills templates to generate descriptions.
Our approach is a fully automatic technique which does not require complex interactions to generate such descriptions.
The case studies and user study demonstrate the usability and effectiveness of \ApproachName.

We envision improving \ApproachName~in several directions.
Several kinds of visual elements such as \texttt{<path>} and \texttt{<polyline>} are not supported yet.
We plan to support more kinds of shapes and visual channels.
Moreover, we plan to support generating descriptions for raster images with techniques that can transfer raster images to SVGs.
Futher more, more kinds of descriptions can be incorporated into \ApproachName.
We plan to genrate descriptions about the meaning of data attributes, the intention of a layout, and more deeper insights with means of graph mining methods.
