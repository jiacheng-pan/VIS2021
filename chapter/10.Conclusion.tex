\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have introduced an automatic approach,~\ApproachName, to extract and express information with descriptions for node-link diagrams.
To understand how node-link diagrams are constructed and what should be explained, we have conducted a pilot study with three graph experts and 12 participants to explore the design of our approach.
We formulated two categories of requirements for~\ApproachName~including four extraction requirements and two expression requirements.
Accordingly, we separate the design of~\ApproachName~into two parts: 1) Three modules search link conditions, summarize visual encodings, and identify layout types. It follows the idea of deconstructing node-link diagrams by inferring the information from visualization results.
2) An description generator organizes template-based descriptions following a pre-set scheme. It constructs a linkage between the visualization and descriptions to enable interactions.
Three case studies and the results from an in-lab study show that~\ApproachName~can effectively express the node-link diagram and help end-users get clear understanding of the visualization.
