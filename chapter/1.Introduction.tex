% ! [1][background and problem] The wide-using of node-link diagrams, 很多创作者使用svg来创作节点链接图，但如果节点链接图的创作者仅仅向受众传达节点链接图本身，而不交代编码信息，无法向受众良好的传达想要表达的意义；
% ! [2][motivation] 创作者可以添加一些附加的components，比如legends、文本描述 或者 tooltips 来辅助受众理解他创作的节点链接图。其中最关键的步骤则是收集创作者创建节点链接图用到的编码方案。虽然创作者对于他创作的节点链接图心知肚明，但仍需要将他所用到的编码重新手动汇总，以进一步使用这些信息来生成附加组件。我们的方法想要减少创作者手动汇总编码信息的劳动，并且提供了一些能够帮助用户理解可视化编码的附加组件，创作者也可以利用提取到的编码信息来生成自定义的附加组件。自动提取编码信息，还能重新审视自己的可视化算法是否存在编码错误的bug。
% ! [3][challenges] 根据xxx等人的调研[x, x, x]，很多工作将节点和链接上的属性分别编码在它们对应的可视化图形上。提取这些编码依赖于检查可视化图形和节点、链接的对应关系，以及图形通道和节点、链接的对应关系。因为节点链接图存在很多视觉遮挡，直接作用于pixel picture的工具很难提取其中包含的编码。而应用在svg上的工具，比如xx，则依赖于作者将数据源绑定在graphics上，并且其无法区分节点和链接，难以应用在节点链接图上。因为我们的方法服务于可视化创作者，他可以直接在开发可视化的过程中使用我们的工具，从而我们聚焦于从可视化算法中提取编码信息，这也使得编码的提取成为可能，因为可视化算法中包含了编码信息。





Node-link diagrams are widely used to depict relations among data entities and associated attributes. 
% These attributes are mapped to visual channels (e.g., the shape, size, and color of a node encode three different attributes in Figure~\ref{fig:BasicCases} (b)) to reveal attribute-based patterns. 
Various visual channels (e.g., position, shape, size, and color) are employed to encode attributes.
However, excessive number of attributes will lead to a heavy cognitive load 
% for human observers to interpret and visually extract 
to perceive information and identify patterns effectively, which brings more impact on novice users with low visualization literacy.
%It is also often that a non-professional user has a low ability of reading visual forms, especially when there are a large amount of visual elements. 
Our idea in this work is to automatically generate descriptions for a multi-attribute node-link 
diagram to enhance the mental understandings to the underlying diagram.

Generating a summarized description for 
% a visualization facilitates its audience to understand its underlying meaning. 
a statistical chart has been popular for its capability of characterizing the meaning of the visualization. 
Existing works 
% for automatic description generation 
classes 
can be categorized into two areas~\cite{DBLP:conf/inlg/ObeidH20}: one describes constituents and visual encodings of a  visualization~\cite{DBLP:journals/coling/MittalMCR98, DBLP:journals/tochi/FerresLST13}, and the other describes high-level insights conveyed by the visualization~\cite{DBLP:conf/apvis/LiuXHWY20, DBLP:conf/inlg/ObeidH20}. By analogizing with the taxonomy of visualization annotation techniques~\cite{DBLP:conf/chi/HullmanDA13}, descriptions generated by 
% the above two 
both 
categories 
% of techniques 
can also be referred to \textit{observational descriptions} and \textit{additive descriptions}. 
% However, techniques for automatically generating descriptions for node-link diagrams have not been explored yet due to the limitations of the above techniques.
However, these approaches are not applicable for node-link diagrams:

\textbf{Observational techniques} assume that constituents (e.g., axes, bars, and legends) of basic charts are well-defined. 
For example, 
% Mittal et al.~\cite{DBLP:journals/coling/MittalMCR98} require 
pre-defined visual mapping relationships 
are demanded~\cite{DBLP:journals/coling/MittalMCR98} 
to generate captions.
In other approaches, textual information of axes and legends is needed~\cite{DBLP:conf/icip/ZhouT00, DBLP:conf/doceng/HuangT07, DBLP:conf/grec/HuangTL03}.
% and other techniques rely on the textual information of axes and legends~\cite{DBLP:conf/icip/ZhouT00, DBLP:conf/doceng/HuangT07, DBLP:conf/grec/HuangTL03}.
% However, textual information in dense node-link diagrams is always hidden to avoid visual clutter. 
This scheme can not be used for dense node-link diagrams since the textual annotations of the nodes and edges need to be hidden to avoid visual clutter.
% Additionally, the complexity of analytical tasks has put forward the challenge of creating more informative diagrams (often achieved by integrating complex glyphs into a node-link diagram to encode the associated attributes), e.g., nesting basic charts into nodes~\cite{gehlenborg2010visualization, DBLP:conf/iv/JusufiDK10} and customizing shapes of links~\cite{DBLP:conf/iv/SchoffelSE16, DBLP:journals/tvcg/NielsenJBJ09}. This further increases the difficulty of interpreting a node-link diagram.
In addition, customized visual encodings in node-link diagrams, such as nesting basic charts into nodes~\cite{gehlenborg2010visualization, DBLP:conf/iv/JusufiDK10} and utilizing alternative shapes for links~\cite{DBLP:conf/iv/SchoffelSE16, DBLP:journals/tvcg/NielsenJBJ09}, make the description of multi-attribute node-link diagrams more challenging. 

\textbf{Additive techniques} generate descriptions from the underlying tabular data based on pre-defined or restricted insights~\cite{DBLP:journals/pvldb/DemiralpHPP17, DBLP:journals/tvcg/WangSZCXMZ20, DBLP:conf/apvis/LiuXHWY20, DBLP:conf/chi/KimHA20}. However, insights in a node-link diagram depend on the topological structure 
% and
, and thus
can be more flexible.


In this paper, we make the very first attempt to generate observational descriptions of node-link diagrams.
% (the first category) considering the remaining technical difficulties for additive descriptions (the second category). 
We contribute~\textit{\ApproachName}, an automatic description generator for node-link diagrams in the format of Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). 
It extracts key information of a diagram from the underlying graph and the source code by following the creating process of node-link diagrams~\cite{DBLP:journals/cgf/SpritzerBDFF15, tvcg/RomatAP21}:
\textbf{1) graph wrangling} transforms the original tabular data into a graph format by defining relationships (links) between entities (nodes);
\textbf{2) visual encoding} maps node/link attributes to visual channels;
\textbf{3) layout computing} positions nodes in a two-dimensional space to reveal attribute-based or topology-based patterns~\cite{DBLP:journals/cgf/NobreMSL19}.
Particularly, \ApproachName~
% first checks the links between all nodes, and 
selects potential links to interpret the \textbf{graph wrangling} process.
Then it obtains \textbf{visual encodings} by continuous data modifications and identifying their effects on the visualization result.
% Ultimately, 
\ApproachName~interprets the \textbf{layout computing} step by examining the factors that influence node positions.
% The extracted information is fed into pre-defined templates to generate textual descriptions. Particularly, we implement an interface to display textual descriptions and support interactive highlight of the text contents by hovering on the corresponding area of the diagram.
A pre-defined template is used to create textual descriptions based on extracted information. 
We design and implement a visual interface to support interactive specification, exploration and modulation of descriptions.
The usability and effectiveness of \ApproachName~are demonstrated by four case studies and a user study.
The contributions of this paper are twofold:

\noindent \textbf{1)} An automatic description generation approach interprets the creating process of a node-link diagram by template-based descriptions.

\noindent \textbf{2)} A visual encoding extraction method retrieves visual encoding schemes from the underlying graph and the code creating diagrams.
